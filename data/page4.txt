<h2>Relational Databases</h2>
<p>
Relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL organize data into structured tables using <strong>SQL</strong>. 
They support joins, indexes, and strong consistency with ACID properties.
</p>

<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>
<p>
NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra offer flexible data models. 
They are ideal for large-scale, distributed applications that require horizontal scaling.
