<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Software Engineering is the disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
Engineers follow principles like <strong>modularity</strong>, <strong>abstraction</strong>, and <strong>separation of concerns</strong> 
to ensure software remains scalable and maintainable.
</p>

<h2>Modern Practices</h2>
<p>
Contemporary engineering teams follow practices such as:
<ul>
    <li>Agile Development</li>
    <li>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)</li>
    <li>Test-Driven Development</li>
    <li>Cloud-Native Architecture</li>
</ul>
These techniques help teams collaborate effectively and ship reliable software.
