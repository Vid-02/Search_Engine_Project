<h2>Understanding AR & VR</h2>
<p>
Augmented Reality (AR) enhances real-world environments with digital elements, while Virtual Reality (VR) 
creates fully immersive digital experiences. These systems rely on 3D modeling, motion tracking, and 
real-time rendering.
</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
AR and VR are widely used in gaming, training simulations, healthcare, architecture, and education.
Challenges include reducing latency, improving realism, and designing intuitive user interfaces.
